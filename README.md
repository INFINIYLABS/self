## Compiling Intu for various platforms

### Getting the files

Clone the Intu git repository onto your local machine by running the following commands in your terminal:

  * `git clone --branch develop --recursive git@github.com:watson-intu/self.git`
  
 Sometimes the sub-modules will not get pulled down, if so then you may need to run this git command after the one above:
 
  * `git submodule update --init --recursive`
  
 If the above command fails, you may need to go add your public ssh key into your profile on github. See https://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits-with-gpg/
 
### Windows

1. Set up [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).
2. Open `/vs2015/self.sln` in this project.
3. Right click on the `self_instance` project and select `Set as startup project`.
4. Right click and select `Properties`. Select the `Debugging` tab and set "Working Directory" to `..\..`.
5. Select Build->Build Solution to build.
6. Select Debug->Start Debugging to run.

### OS X

1. Set up [CMake](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-1/dev/cpp/install_guide.html#required-buidsys). To install CMake by using Homebrew, run `brew install cmake`.
  * To install Homebrew, run the following command in your terminal: ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
2. Set up [qiBuild](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-1/dev/cpp/install_guide.html#qibuild-install).
  * `pip install qibuild` (NOTE: it is highly recommended to download [anaconda python version 2.7](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) to have pip correctly configured)
  * `qibuild config --wizard` (use default setup for steps by pressing 1 twice)
3. Run the following commands:
  * `cd {self root directory}`
  * `./scripts/build_mac.sh`
  
This process stages the executables in the `bin/mac` directory on your local computer. You can change into that directory and run the unit_test and self_instance executables.

PS: If you run into issues with the build, you might have to change a couple of Boost header files, as described here: https://github.com/Homebrew/legacy-homebrew/issues/27396 (specifically, you might have to replace your copy of Boost's boost/atomic/detail/cas128strong.hpp and boost/atomic/detail/gcc-atomic.hpp with the latest available in the Boost directory)

### Linux

1. Set up qibuild and CMake. You can use your Linux package manager to install CMake, and any distribution of Python (2.7 recommended) to install qibuild through pip.
2. Run the following commands:
  * `./scripts/build_linux.sh`

### Raspberry Pi

**Note:** If any step below fails or errors, run: `sudo apt-get update`, then repeat the step.

1.	Install Raspbian Operating System onto your Raspbery Pi

2.	Open up a new browser window on your laptop and download [**Anaconda 4.2.0 For Linux Python 2.7 version**](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

	**Make sure you download the correct version.** You need the LINUX version no matter what operating system you have. Windows users may have to right click and select **Save as** to save the download locally.

3.	Copy Anaconda from your laptop over to the Pi. **Windows** users may need to [download](https://filezilla-project.org/) and use something like **Filezilla** to copy files over to the Pi.
	1. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded Anaconda locally.
	2. Copy Anaconda from your laptop over to the Pi using the following command: `scp Anaconda2-4.2.0-Linux-x86.sh pi@{ip}:/home/pi` 
		(e.g. `scp Anaconda2-4.2.0-Linux-x86.sh pi@10.0.1.2:/home/pi`)
		If prompted, the username is **pi** and password is **raspberry**

4.	Install Anaconda on your Pi and set up qiBuild.
	1. In a new Terminal/PuTTY window, ssh into your Pi: `ssh pi@{ip_address}`. When prompted, the username is **pi** and password is **raspberry**.
	2.	Run: `bash Anaconda2-4.2.0-Linux-x86.sh`.
	3. Follow the steps on the screen to install Anaconda. When you get to the license, keep hitting Enter to jump to the bottom. Type **yes** to approve the license.
	4.	Hit Enter to install Anaconda in the default location. **Note**: It may take a while for the progress to update, and if you get the following error, please ignore it.

	```
	Anaconda2-4.2.0-Linux-x86.sh: line 484: /home/pi/anaconda2/pkgs/python-3.5.2-0/bin/python: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error
	ERROR:
	cannot execute native linux-32 binary, output from 'uname -a' is:
	Linux raspberrypi 4.4.21-v7+ #911 SMP Thu Sep 15 14:22:38 BST 2016 armv7l GNU/Linux
	```
	
	5. Once Anaconda has successfully installed, run: `sudo apt-get install python-pip cmake`. 
	
		**Note:** If this fails, run `sudo apt-get update`, and then rerun: `sudo apt-get install python-pip cmake`.

	6.	Run: `sudo pip install qibuild`
 
5.	Install the wiringPi library on the Pi.
	1. In a new Terminal/PuTTY window, ssh into your Pi: `ssh pi@{ip_address}`. 
	2.	Navigate to your Pi's **home directory** by running: `cd /home/pi`. 
	3.	Run: `git clone git://git.drogon.net/wiringPi`
	4.	Now navigate into the wiringPi directory by running: `cd wiringPi/`
	5.	Run: `./build`

	You should see a list of classes compiled and “All Done” at the end.

6.	Build Intu on the Pi
	1. In your current (or a new) ssh session to the Raspberry Pi, navigate to the self directory: `cd {self root directory}`
	2. Mark the build script as executable by running: `chmod +x scripts/build_raspi.sh`
	3. Now build the Self SDK by running: `scripts/build_raspi.sh`

	**Note:** If you have any build errors, run: `scripts/clean.sh` and then rerun: `scripts/build_raspi.sh`

7. 	Run Intu on the Pi
	1. If you have a HDMI cable plugged into your Raspberry Pi, verify that the sound is set to analog. This can be done by right clicking the speaker icon at the top right hand corner of the Raspberry Pi's homescreen, and selecting analog.

	2. Verify that you have a microphone and speaker plugged into your Raspberry Pi. Note that your speaker may need to be charged before use. Make sure that it is turned on before proceeding with the next step.

	3. Navigate to the raspi directory using: `cd {self root directory}/bin/raspi`.
	
	4. Run: `./run_self.sh`
    
This process installs Intu on the remote device whose user name and IP address you provide. You can go to the `~/self/latest` directory on that device and run `run_self.sh`. This process was tested on Red Hat Enterprise 6.6 and 6.7.

### Aldebaran Nao and Pepper robots using OS X

1. Set up [CMake](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-1/dev/cpp/install_guide.html#required-buidsys).
2. Set up [qiBuild](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-1/dev/cpp/install_guide.html#qibuild-install).
3. Run the following commmands:
  * `./scripts/build_nao.sh`
4. Run the following command to install into on the given robot using scp:
  * `./scripts/install_nao.sh [user@host]`
5. SSH to your robot, cd into `self\latest` and run the `run_self.sh` script.

  
## Getting Started
After downloading and building the code base, you can now run **Intu**. 

**Windows**: To run Intu on Windows, click the play button in Visual Studio. A web browser will open.

**Mac**: To run Intu on Mac, from your Intu directory, navigate to the `bin/mac` directory and execute the following command: `./run_self.sh`. A web browser will open.
 

## Configuring Intu
If running Intu for the very first time, it will load the initial configuration from the file etc/shared/bootstrap.json. This replaces the previous body.json, but is exactly the same format. Once you run, you must use a web browser to access the dashboard end-point (e.g. http://localhost:9443/www/dashboard). Alternatively, provided your not using a remote graph, you may delete the db/knowledge.db to wipe the local graph (which will purge all other data stored in the graph). Once deleted, next time you run Intu it will reload the etc/shared/boostrap.json again.

## Configuring BlueMix
While it is not required, we recommend using IBM Bluemix services. To register for a Bluemix account, go to `https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/`. 

At a minimum you will need a **Conversation** service, a **Speech to Text** service, and a **Text to Speech** service to use Intu.  If you are using IBM Bluemix's Conversation service, we have provided a sample workspace you can import and use.  For further instructions on how to use this workspace, jump to the [Getting Started with Conversation](#Conversation) section below.

To configure your services:

1. Click on the Menu button located on the left side of your browser.
2. Click on the Configure icon (the second icon from the top, above Logs).
3. Click on the `SERVICES CONFIG` button. You will be directed to a Services Config page.
4. Click on the **+** button next to the service you are configuring. An expanded view will appear.
5. Enter a username and password (if the service has one).  Click save.
6. **Reminder**: At a minimum you need to configure the following three services: **ConversationV1**, **SpeechToTextV1**, and **TextToSpeechV1**.  All other services are optional but can add extra functionality to Intu.
7. For your Conversation service, you will also need to add a workspace id.  Click on the Menu button -> Configure icon (second icon from the top) -> CLASSIFIERS button. You will be directed to the Classifiers configuration page.
8. Click on the **+** button for **TextClassifier**.  An expanded view will appear.
9. Search for the `self_dialog` workspace key.  Above it you will see a `m_WorkspaceId` field.  Input your own workspace id in this field.  Click save.
10. Your instance of Intu is now ready to use.



### <a name="Conversation">Getting started with Conversation</a>

Located in the `etc/shared` directory is a Conversation service workspace named **intu\_conversation\_v1.json**. This workspace helps you visualize how intents, entities, and dialog are developed. You can expand on this workspace or use it as a guide for developing your own later.  To import this workspace, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your Conversation service.
2. Click **Launch tool**.
3. You will be directed to your workspace dashboard.
4. Click on the import icon (located next to the `Create` button).
5. Select the Conversation workspace json we have provided: `etc/shared/intu_conversation_v1.json`.
6. This Conversation workspace will automatically open once it is imported successfully.
7. You may now edit or view this Conversation workspace.
